								<span class="image main"><img src="images/intro.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am Yosef Wolday, and my professional journey from healthcare to becoming a full-stack engineer has been both unique and gratifying. Holding an M.B.A. in Health Administration and a B.S. in Health Science, my initial aspiration was to utilize my hands and skills to aid in healing the sick and caring for patients.</p>
								<p>However, my path took an unexpected turn when I became part of a healthtech startup, exposing me to the realms of technology and artificial intelligence. This introduction opened my eyes to a new way of making a meaningful impact—using code to develop applications that enhance and transform lives. Drawing on my background as a Surgical Technician and Medical Assistant, I progressed from an Operations Supervisor to my current role as a Full-Stack Engineer.</p>
								<p>In my current capacity, I now find immense satisfaction in using my hands to drive innovation that resonates in my unwavering commitment to contribute to the further of individuals’ lives.</p>
